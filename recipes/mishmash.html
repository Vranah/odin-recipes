    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            Mish Mash is a very easy-to-prepare traditional Bulgarian dish that makes a tasty inexpensive Keto-friendly and gluten-free meal. Easy to digest and nourishing, it’s perfect for brunch or light dinner. Back home, the dish is prepared typically in summer, with fresh vegetables, eggs and feta cheese. This jumble dish may remind you of scrambled eggs, however, for the Bulgarians, it’s much more than that! It’s everyone’s favourite summer dish.

            <li>Start by sauteing the onions for 5-10 minutes until translucent, then add the chopped peppers. Stir and saute them for about 10 minutes. Add the diced or grated tomatoes. Sprinkle the dry spices on top and stir to combine</li>
            <li>When the moisture in the dish evaporates, add the eggs. Stir the dish to integrate the eggs with the vegetables</li>
